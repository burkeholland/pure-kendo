The website has\nextensive documentation and examples necessary to get you started using Pure.\n\nYou can include the Pure CSS file in your project by fetching it from Yahoo's\nCDN:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/pure/0.1.0/pure-min.css\">\n```\n\n\nBuild From Source\n-----------------\n\nOptionally, you can build Pure from its source on Github. To do this, you'll\nneed to have NodeJS and npm installed. We use Grunt to build Pure.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone git@github.com:yui/pure.git\n$ cd pure\n$ npm install\n$ grunt\n```\n\nNow, all Pure CSS files should be built into the `pure/build/` directory. All\nfiles that are in this build directory are also available on the CDN. The naming\nconventions of the files in the `build/` directory follow these rules:\n\n* `[module]-nr.css`: Rollup of `[module]-core.css` + `[module].css` +\n  `[module]-[feature].css` from the `src/[module]/` dir. This is the\n  non-responsive version of a module.\n\n* `[module].css`: Rollup of `[module]-nr.css` + `[module]-r.css` from the\n  `build/` dir. This is the responsive version of a module.\n\n* `*-min.css`: A minified file version of the files of the same name.\n\n* `pure-min.css`: A rollup of all `[module]-min.css` files in the `build/` dir.\n  This is a responsive roll-up of everything.\n\n* `pure-nr-min.css`: A Rollup of all modules without @media queries. This is a\n  non-responsive roll-up of everything.\n\n### Building Specific Modules\n\nYou can build a specific module by passing in its name into Grunt:\n\n```shell\n$ grunt grids\n```\n\n\nContributions and Code Standards\n--------------------------------\n\nFeel free to file bugs and submit pull requests on Github! When submitting a\npull request, please checkout a new feature branch, and submit your pull request\nfrom it. Please do not submit pull requests from your `master` branch.\n\n### Versioning\n\nPure adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0](http://semver.org/).\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis software is free to use under the Yahoo!
